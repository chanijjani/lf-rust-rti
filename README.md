# Rust RTI: Lingua Franca Runtime Infrastructure (RTI) in Rust Language

This repository contains the Rust code for Lingua Franca (LF)'s Runtime Infrastructure (RTI) for federated execution of LF.

> **_Disclaimer_**
>
> This RTI is still work-in-progress with unimplemented functionalities, thus, this may not work for certain federated LF programs.
> Please let @chanijjani or @hokeun know if you find any issue when running federated LF programs with this Rust RTI.

## Quick Start

TODO

```
cargo run -- -n 2
```

# Current Status

- Passing federated tests with Rust RTI: SimpleFederated.lf, StopAtShutdown.lf, DistributedCount.lf, DistributedStop.lf, PingPongDistibuted.lf
